# PassTap
######www.passtap.com
Our project for MHacks 8. A password manager Chrome extension that uses your phone to authenticate.

This project consists of a Chrome extension, a server, and an Android app that work together to make your life easier. The extension will automatically generate passwords based on a hash for any site you tell it to, and when you want to log in it will push to your phone asking you to authenticate with a fingerprint. You never need to remember passwords again! Best of all, your passwords aren't stored anywhere. Go to our website to download the extension and apk.

##What Is It?
Simple
PassTap requires no master key, account creation, or local storage. Simply install the smartphone app and type the single use key into our chrome extension. No other set up necessary.

##Fast
Accessing your sites is still lightening fast. No logging into a database. Simply open your webpage and a notification will automatically be sent to your phone to authorize the log in.

##Secure
All passwords are secure hashes of private data, meaning that they're impossible to guess and unique across every website you visit. Never worry about insecure passwords again.

##Protected
PassTap never saves your password, anywhere! Passwords are generated from private data stored safely on your phone, assessable only via your explicit authorization. You know exactly any time your account is being accessed, and not even you can leak your password.
