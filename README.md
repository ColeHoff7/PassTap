# TouchPass
Our project for MHacks 8. A password manager Chrome extension that uses your phone to authenticate.

This project consists of a Chrome extension, a server, and an app that work together to make your life easier. The extension will automatically generate passwords for any site you tell it to, and when you want to log in it will push to your phone asking you to authenticate with a fingerprint. You never need to remember passwords again!
