Our project for MHacks 8. A password manager Chrome extension that uses your phone to authenticate.

This project consists of a Chrome extension, a server, and an Android app that work together to make your life easier. The extension will automatically generate passwords based on a hash for any site you tell it to, and when you want to log in it will push to your phone asking you to authenticate with a fingerprint. You never need to remember passwords again! Best of all, your passwords aren't stored anywhere.
